    gcloud config - view and edit Cloud SDK properties

[m[1mSYNOPSIS[m
    [mgcloud config[m [4mGROUP[m | [4mCOMMAND[m [[4mGLOBAL-FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of gcloud
    and other tools in the Cloud SDK. The SDK provides a configuration named
    [mdefault[m whose initial properties are set when you run the [mgcloud init[m
    command. You can create any number of additional named configurations using
    [mgcloud init[m or [mgcloud config configurations create[m, and switch between
    configurations using [mgcloud config configurations activate[m.

    gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in a
    configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the [m--project[m flag and
    [mproject[m property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect
    command behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to
    maintain the same settings across command executions.

    For more information on configurations, see [mgcloud topic configurations[m.

[m[1mGLOBAL FLAGS[m
    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for a description of flags available to all commands.

[m[1mGROUPS[m
    [m[4mGROUP[m[m is one of the following:

     [1mconfigurations[m
        Manage the set of gcloud named configurations.

[m[1mCOMMANDS[m
    [m[4mCOMMAND[m[m is one of the following:

     [1mget-value[m
        Print the value of a Cloud SDK property.

     [1mlist[m
        View Cloud SDK properties.

     [1mset[m
        Set a Cloud SDK property.

     [1munset[m
        Unset a Cloud SDK property.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            The account gcloud should use for authentication. You can run
            [mgcloud auth list[m to see the accounts you currently have available.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. The [m--global[m flag will be required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            For any prompts that require user input, an error will be raised.
            This is the equivalent of using the global [m--quiet[m flag.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This is value is set based on your choices during installation, but
            can be changed at any time. For more information, see:
            https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. You may need
            to adjust your [mverbosity[m setting if you want to see in the
            terminal, otherwise it is available in the log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, defaults to 30.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            The project id of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by
            default. This can be overridden by using the global [m--project[m flag.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            If False, messages to the user and command output on both standard
            output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            The default logging verbosity for gcloud commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [m--verbosity[m flag.

     [4mapp[m
         [1mcloud_build_timeout[m
            The timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete
            during deployments. All Docker builds now use the Container Builder
            API.

         [1mstop_previous_version[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

     [4mcomponent_manager[m
         [1madditional_repositories[m
            A comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the [mgcloud
            components repositories[m commands.

         [1mdisable_update_check[m
            If True, the Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     [4mcompute[m
         [1mregion[m
            The default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a [m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [mgcloud compute regions list[m.

         [1mzone[m
            The default zone to use when working with zonal Compute Engine
            resources. When a [m--zone[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [mgcloud compute zones list[m.

     [4mcontainer[m
         [1mbuild_timeout[m
            The timeout, in seconds, to wait for container builds to complete.
